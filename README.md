## Welcome
Here resides the source code for my personal page hosted on GitHub Pages, which I created with React. I am using this project as my tool to learn React and some other tools such as ESLint and Travis CI. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and utilizes several open source contributions.

## Attributions
Special thanks to the open source community; I could not have accomplished this project without their contributions.
* HTML5 for the template and CSS to create my theme
* [react-scroll-up](https://github.com/milosjanda/react-scroll-up) for the cool scroll-to-the-top component
* [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) for the React app scaffolding
* ESLint utility which ensures that my coding style remains consistent throughout the project
* Travis CI for the continous integration platform to run tests and builds
